The arguments for the initial run of this project is as:-d 6000,10 -s 600 -m taylor -w C00267 -f metabolicPathway-05-16-2017-DebugPurpose.xml -e SubstratesDatabase-05-04-2017-ProgramPurpose-sample.txt -g NanConst -i 4.25,11.55,74.83,42.62;260,50,50;180 -c initialConcentrations0.txtwhich I added another argument -c for the modified concentrations.Please count up for the file to 99. I have used a code in line 90 of AffiliationFinder.java to make 100 relatively good initial concentrations. You can make more files using that code to that specific folder. It is an easy code. No complications.The argument in front of -c goes to the folder of the project. So, if you wrote a shell, please be careful and refer ot the files in the folder "initialConcentrations" besides "src" folder that contains the modified concentration files.
